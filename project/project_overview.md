## Overview  
Teams will undertake a semester long (**5 weeks**) project in groups of 5. The project will consist of proposing a software project, which includes developing an application consisting of a database, frontend, and backend processes, as well as marketing analysis and documenting the development process. Students will be mostly graded on their use of, and adherence to, a software development methodology for the project. The final project grade will consider the progress towards product delivery, the difficulty of the project, as well as the delivery of materials required for each of the milestones for the project.

All documentation, code, and other materials related to this project will be stored in a GIT  repository. It is expected that team members will frequently update the files in the repository. If pair programming is used, both names of the pair must be included in the commit message to receive credit for participation in the project. Submissions for all milestones must be merged into the repository before the deadline or all members of the team will be penalized for late work.

The purpose of this project is to provide the basis for applying the tools and methodologies that are explored in the course.  Group work is an essential part of computer science, both in academia and industry. This project will increase your skills in communications and teamwork, while providing handsCon use of many different tools.

Team Formation
Teams will be formed using the CATME.org website, which takes your work schedule, work habits, and other demographics into consideration when forming teams. We want to create groups according to similar work schedules and work habits, but maintain diversity across the other demographics.

Milestones
Software project often have deliverables and delivery schedules associated with the productions of code.   These team projects will be graded based on the delivery of materials at seven milestones  
  
|             |           |                  |  
|:-----------:|:---------:|:----------------:|  
| Milestone 1 | 40 Points | Project Proposal |  
| Milestone 2 | 40 Points | Agile Client Demo and Write Up of Milestones and Retrospective |  
| Milestone 3 | 40 Points | Database Design |  
| Milestone 4 | 40 Points | Unit Testing / Integration Testing (Subject to Change) |  
| Milestone 5 | 40 Points | Project Presentations |  
| Milestone 6 | 50 Points | Final Project Report and Product Functionality |  
  
Your individual grade will be based on your participation as reported by your teammates, the project difficulty, as well as the team project grade.  Your level of participation within your group will affect your final grade. If you do not participate throughout the project, you will not pass the course. Project difficulty is based on the overall effort of the team in producing the results reported in the final report.
